\section{Work Experience}

\affiliation[Cofounder and CTO]
{Decision AI}
{March 2016 - Present}


\begin{compactitem}
\item Built \href{https://app.decision.ai}{app.decision.ai}, a web app for simulating business situations (React frontend / GCP backend).
\end{compactitem}


\affiliation[Software Engineer]
{Amazon}
{August 2017 - March 2020}


\begin{compactitem}
\item Built operations-related tooling (metrics reporting, alarms, CLIs used by oncalls, etc.) for AWS Elastic File System.
\item Proposed and designed a new oncall structure for Elastic File System where engineers would be on call for their individual teams instead of the service as a whole. This meant problems were surfaced to the engineers most able to understand them and most incentivized to fix them, reducing overall oncall burden.
\end{compactitem}


\affiliation[Software Engineer]
{Wave}
{December 2016 - June 2017}


\begin{compactitem}
\item Fought fraud with heuristics and machine learning; later, led engineering for the international transfers team.
\end{compactitem}



\affiliation[Software Engineer]
{DataRobot}
{December 2015 - December 2016}


\begin{compactitem}
\item Expanded DataRobot's customer-facing API for interacting with its machine learning product by designing and implementing backend API routes, corresponding (Python and R) client package functionality, and providing API guidance to other teams implementing new functionality. I also helped customers see the value in automating their workflows, leading the API to shift from an afterthought to a major priority for the company.
\end{compactitem}


\affiliation[Data Scientist \& Software Engineer]
{Kaggle (7\textsuperscript{th} employee)}
{January 2012 - August 2015}


\begin{compactitem}
\item Designed Kaggle's infrastructure for feature creation and fitting/evaluating models across a range of model types, feature sets, geography, and validation method (for our oil \& gas consulting arm of the business).
\item Spearheaded the use of interactive (Shiny) apps for exploratory visualization and visualizing the output of models. After some refinement, we used these apps in conversations with customers, leading customers to better understand and benefit from our work.
\end{compactitem}


\affiliation[Predictive Modeler]
{Allstate Insurance}
{October 2011 - January 2012}
{Associate Predictive Modeler}
{April 2010 - October 2011}


\begin{compactitem}
\item Built predictive models as the basis for Allstate's homeowners and auto insurance rating plans.
\item Proposed/prototyped a tool to measure the effect of implementing a rating plan with deviations from the model.
\end{compactitem}

\section{Education}

\affiliation[M.S. in Mathematics]

\section{Academic Research}

\affiliation[Graduate Research]
{Department of Mathematics, University of Chicago}
{April 2009 - March 2010}
{}
{}
\begin{compactitem}
\item Investigated machine learning methods for
high-dimensional (esp. semi-supervised) settings that exploit a lower-dimensional manifold structure by finding a good
basis for functions which are smooth on the manifold.
\end{compactitem}
