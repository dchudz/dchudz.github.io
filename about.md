Hi! I work at Kaggle building statistical models.

## Stuff I've Made

### [R Package for Average Predictive Comparisons](http://dchudz.github.io/predcomps/)

Complicated models will often fit your data better than simple ones, but it's harder to understand what they're telling you. [Here](dchudz.github.io/predcomps/) is a project I'm working on to help with that.

### [Website for Knitters](http://plannedpooling.com)

This is a site I made is useful for something some knitters do called "planned pooling". It gets about 1000 unique visitors per month.
